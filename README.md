Hi!
Pretty much all the code I wrote is in App.js and App.css within the src folder; the rest was generated by node.js when I ran `npx create-react-app`. 
The page is published with Github Pages, at https://jackfulton42.github.io/SpidrDemo/

The submit button logs the fields' values to the console then clears the fields.
